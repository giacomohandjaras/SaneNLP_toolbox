%%%%Test word-embeddings from a english-based corpora with behavioral feature-norming data from Lenci et al., 2013.
%%%% 	Lenci, A., Baroni, M., Cazzolli, G., & Marotta, G. (2013). 
%%%% 	BLIND: A set of semantic feature norms from the congenitally blind.

%%%%
%%%%Basic usage: 
%%%%	[r,rho,coverage]=SNLP_benchmark_eng_lenci2013(corpora)
%%%%
%%%%	corpora: a char variable indicating the filename of a .mat containing word2vec emmbeddings 
%%%%	         or directly the struct containing word-ebbendings data (see SNLP_convert_from_word2vec_to_mat).
%%%%	r: the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the RDM from word-embeddings of the corpora 
%%%%	   (cosine distance) and the RDM (cosine distance) obtained from behavioral data.
%%%%	rho: as above but using Spearman's rho.
%%%%	coverage: since the vocabulary of the word-embeddings depends on the size of the corpora,
%%%%	          some words present in behavioral data could not be represented in the word-embeddings. 
%%%%	          Coverage measures the overlap in % between the words in behavioral data and the corpora. 
%%%%
%%%%Advanced usage: 
%%%%	[r,rho,coverage,RDM_behav,RDM_corpora,concepts_labels]=SNLP_benchmark_eng_lenci2013(corpora,smoothing)
%%%%
%%%%	smoothing: a positive float (generally between 0 and 1) or an array of positive floats indicating the level of gaussian smoothings 
%%%%	           (sigma of a distro centered on a cosine distance of 0) to be tested (see SNLP_getWordVectorsSmoothed)
%%%%	RDM_behav: RDM (cosine distance) obtained from behavioral data 
%%%%	RDM_corpora: RDM (cosine distance) obtained from word-embeddings
%%%%	concepts_labels: the labels of the stimuli used to generate RDM_behav and RDM_corpora
